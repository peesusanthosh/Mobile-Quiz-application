This is a android mobile quiz test application
Trivia questions will be downloaded as an JSON file from a remote server. 
I am using JSON parsing to get the questions and generating the proper user interface for showing each parsed question. 
This project is composed of three Activities, which include: Main, Trivia, and Stats Activities
